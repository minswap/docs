Staking MIN is one of the easiest ways to earn passive rewards in the Minswap ecosystem. Whether you received MIN from farming rewards, trading, the Liquidity Bootstrapping Event, or the earlier FISO, staking allows you to put those tokens to work instead of leaving them idle in your wallet.

Minswap offers both flexible and locked staking options. This module walks you through why staking is valuable and how to stake, claim, and withdraw your MIN tokens directly from the app.

### What Is MIN Staking?

MIN staking lets you deposit your MIN tokens into Minswap's staking contracts to earn additional MIN rewards over time.\
Staking is:

* **Non-custodial** — you maintain control of your tokens
* **Passive** — rewards accumulate automatically
* **Easy to manage** — the interface shows your staked amount, rewards, and options clearly

### Why Stake Your MIN?

* **Earn passive yield**\
  Your MIN generates more MIN over time.
* **Flexible or fixed options**\
  Choose between short-term liquidity or higher long-term rewards.
* **Supports the Minswap ecosystem**\
  Staked tokens contribute to protocol stability and community incentives.
* **Low-effort income**\
  Set and forget — rewards accrue without active management.

### Staking Options on Minswap

#### Flexible Staking

* Withdraw anytime
* Lower APY
* Best for traders who may want to exit positions quickly
* Rewards can be claimed at any time

#### 9-Month Locked Staking

* Higher APY (e.g., \~8.66% at time of recording)
* Tokens are locked for the full period
* Ideal for long-term MIN holders
* Rewards accumulate and follow the contract’s rules

#### 2. Choose a Staking Option

Minswap prepares the on-chain transaction.

#### 5. Sign & Submit the Transaction

### How to Claim Staking Rewards

2. Expand your staking position
3. Click **Claim**
4. Sign and submit the transaction

Your claimed MIN will return to your wallet almost instantly.

### How to Unstake MIN (Flexible Staking Only)

If you're using the flexible staking option, you can withdraw your tokens at any time.

1. Open your staking position
2. Click **Withdraw**
3. Choose the amount or select 100%
4. Sign the transaction

Your MIN will return to your wallet after confirmation.

### Key Notes

* Locked staking provides higher APY but no early withdrawal
* Flexible staking provides liquidity but at a lower rate
* Rewards only compound when you manually claim and restake
* Staking does not automatically count toward governance voting unless contracts support delegation; governance snapshots use held MIN at a specific block

Staking MIN is a simple and effective way to earn passive rewards in the Minswap ecosystem. With both flexible and locked options, you can choose a strategy that aligns with your goals:

* Stake MIN
* Earn rewards
* Claim or withdraw whenever needed

If you’re holding MIN anyway, staking ensures your tokens keep working for you.
