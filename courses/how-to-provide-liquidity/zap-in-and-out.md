## What is Zap In?

“Zap In” is a feature on Minswap that simplifies adding liquidity to a liquidity pool (LP) by automatically converting a single asset into the necessary pair of tokens. In traditional decentralised exchanges (DEXs), providing liquidity requires a user to supply equal amounts of two different tokens for the specific liquidity pool. Zap In streamlines this process by allowing users to deposit a single token, and the platform handles the conversion into the appropriate token pair.

This is very useful when you want to provide liquidity into a pool of a new token that you do not yet have.

### How Does Zap In Work?

* **Select a Pool**: The user selects the liquidity pool to which they wish to contribute. For example, a user may want to provide liquidity to an ADA/USDM pool.
* **Single Token Deposit**: Instead of needing to deposit both ADA and USDM in equal values, the user can use the Zap In feature to deposit only ADA or only USDM.
* **Automated Conversion**: The Zap In feature automatically swaps half of the deposited token (e.g., ADA) into the other token needed for the pool (e.g., USDM) via a decentralised exchange. This happens in the background, simplifying the process for the user.
* **Liquidity Provision**: After the conversion, the two tokens are added to the liquidity pool, allowing the user to become a liquidity provider (LP) and earn rewards from trading fees or incentives tied to the pool.

### Benefits of Zap In

* **Convenience**: Users no longer need to manually swap tokens before adding liquidity, saving time and reducing complexity.
* **Reduced Transactions**: Normally, adding liquidity involves multiple transactions (swapping one asset for another and then adding liquidity). Zap In reduces this to a single transaction, lowering transaction fees and streamlining the process.
* **Lower Slippage Risk**: By handling the swap in one step, Zap In reduces the chances of experiencing high slippage when converting one token to another, especially in volatile markets.
* **Enhanced User Experience**: For users unfamiliar with liquidity pools or token swaps, Zap In makes the process more accessible by simplifying liquidity provision to a few clicks.

### Use Case Example

Let’s say you hold ADA and want to provide liquidity to the ADA/USDM pool. Instead of manually swapping half of your ADA for USDM and then providing both tokens to the pool, Zap In allows you to deposit ADA. The system automatically converts half of the ADA into USDM and provides both tokens to the pool in the correct ratio, allowing you to start earning liquidity rewards immediately.

## What is Zap Out?

[![IMinswap Course MinWallet Setup](https://img.youtube.com/vi/nTD9bgOWU1s/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTD9bgOWU1s)

“Zap Out” is a feature on Minswap that simplifies the process of withdrawing liquidity from a liquidity pool (LP) by allowing users to convert their liquidity tokens to a single token of their choice. In traditional decentralised exchanges (DEXs), withdrawing liquidity often requires users to take out equal amounts of both tokens they provided, which can be cumbersome and time-consuming. Zap Out streamlines this process by letting users withdraw their funds and convert them into a single asset with minimal effort.

### How Does Zap Out Work?

* **Select the Pool**: The user selects the liquidity pool from which they want to withdraw their liquidity. For instance, they may want to withdraw from the ADA/USDM pool.
* **Specify Withdrawal Amount**: The user indicates the amount of liquidity tokens they wish to withdraw. These tokens represent the user’s share of the liquidity pool.
* **Automatic Conversion**: Upon executing the Zap Out, Minswap automatically calculates the amounts of both tokens in the pool corresponding to the withdrawn liquidity tokens. It then converts one of those tokens (e.g., ADA) into the desired single asset (e.g., USDM) or vice versa.
* **Receive the Chosen Token**: After the automatic conversion, the user receives the specified single token in their wallet, making it easy to access funds without managing multiple tokens.

### Benefits of Zap Out

* **Convenience**: Users can withdraw liquidity and receive their funds in a single token, eliminating the need to manage multiple tokens from the pool.
* **Reduced Complexity**: By automating the conversion process, Zap Out reduces the complexity involved in withdrawing liquidity, making it more user-friendly for those unfamiliar with the mechanics of liquidity provision.
* **Fewer Transactions**: Typically, withdrawing liquidity involves multiple steps, including withdrawing and swapping the tokens. Zap Out combines these actions into a single transaction, which can lower gas fees and simplify the process.
* **Flexibility in Token Selection**: Users can choose which token they want to receive, providing flexibility to manage their portfolios according to their trading or investment strategies.

### Use Case Example

Imagine you provided liquidity to the ADA/USDM pool on Minswap. Now, you want to withdraw your liquidity and prefer to receive USDM instead of holding both ADA and USDM.

**Using Zap Out**: You select the pool and indicate how much liquidity you wish to withdraw. Minswap calculates the amounts of ADA and USDM you are entitled to based on your pool share. Instead of withdrawing both tokens, Zap Out automatically converts your share of ADA to USDM and delivers the total amount in USDM to your wallet.
