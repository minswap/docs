Decentralised Finance (DeFi) unlocks powerful tools like yield farming, token swaps, and staking without intermediaries—but with this freedom comes responsibility. Platforms like Minswap, while non-custodial and secure by design, still require users to practise caution and follow good security hygiene to avoid risks such as phishing, scams, and user error.

### Understand the Core Risks in DeFi

Before diving into best practices, it’s important to understand the types of risks in the DeFi space:

* **Phishing attacks**: Fake sites mimicking Minswap to steal funds
* **Malicious smart contracts**: Tokens or dApps that exploit wallet permissions
* **Human error**: Sending funds to wrong addresses, mismanaging keys
* **Impersonation scams**: Fake support channels on X, Discord, or Telegram

Minswap itself is audited and open-source, but no protocol can protect users from unsafe habits.

### Best Practices to Stay Safe on Minswap

#### 1. Use a Hardware Wallet (e.g., Ledger or Trezor)

Never store large amounts of ADA or tokens in hot wallets (e.g., Nami, Eternl).\
Hardware wallets keep private keys offline, making it nearly impossible for a hacker to access your funds.

#### 2. Double Check URLs

* Official site: https://minswap.org
* Bookmark the site to avoid fake phishing URLs.
* Never click links from unsolicited DMs or social media comments.

#### 3. Manage Wallet Permissions

* Check which dApps have access to your wallet using tools like CCVault’s collateral checker or your wallet’s token access settings.
* Revoke access to tokens or contracts you no longer use.

#### 4. Verify Token Contracts

* When adding a new token to trade or farm, make sure it’s a verified token on Minswap or listed on CardanoCube or TapTools.
* Avoid low-volume tokens unless you understand the project.

#### 5. Be Skeptical of “Support” Accounts

* Minswap will never DM you first on Discord, Telegram, or X.
* Scammers often impersonate admins and offer to “help recover” funds or “upgrade” your wallet.
* Always use the official community links from the Minswap website.

#### 6. Record and Back Up Seed Phrases — Offline

* Write down your wallet’s seed phrase and store it securely offline (preferably in two separate physical locations).
* Never take a screenshot or store it on cloud storage.

#### 7. Enable Spending Limits or Multisig Wallets (Advanced)

* For larger portfolios, consider multi-signature wallets or use wallets with spending caps to limit risk exposure.

#### 8. Watch Out for Fake Analytics or Airdrops

* Only use official Minswap Analytics at https://analytics.minswap.org
* Ignore messages or websites claiming to offer “MIN airdrops” or “staking rewards” via third-party platforms.

#### 9. Don’t Rush. Always Review

* Whether you’re farming, staking, or swapping tokens, double-check the transaction details in your wallet before signing.
* Watch for suspicious fees or unknown token interactions.

When in doubt, ask in official community channels—but **never share your private key**.
