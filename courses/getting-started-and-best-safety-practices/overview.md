### Prerequisites Before You Start Your DeFi Journey on Minswap

Ensuring you’re well-prepared before diving into Minswap and the DeFi ecosystem is important. Here are some key considerations and tools you’ll need:

**1. Understanding DeFi Basics** Familiarise yourself with decentralised finance (DeFi) principles, including liquidity pools, automated market makers (AMMS), and yield farming.

Learn how DeFi protocols work and the risks and rewards of participating in liquidity provisioning.

**2. A Cardano-Compatible Wallet** Set Up a Wallet: To interact with Minswap, you’ll need a Cardano-compatible wallet, such as Lace, Eternl, or Typhon.

Fund Your Wallet: Ensure your wallet is funded with ADA and any other tokens you wish to trade or provide liquidity. You’ll need ADA for transaction fees.

**3. Knowledge of Token Pairs and Liquidity Pools** Understand the token pairs available on Minswap and the importance of liquidity pools. Consider the risks, especially impermanent loss, before contributing to a pool.

Research the token projects you’re interested in and evaluate their stability and potential for growth.

**4. Risk Management and Strategy** Impermanent Loss: Be aware of the risk of impermanent loss, which occurs when the price of assets in a liquidity pool diverges.

Market Volatility: The crypto market is volatile, so always have a risk management strategy. Diversify your investments and use tools to track market movements.

**5. Transaction Fees** Understand how transaction fees work on Minswap. Every swap and liquidity transaction will incur a small fee, typically paid in ADA.

Review the adjustable fee model in V2 and choose pools that align with your risk/reward preferences.

**6. Familiarise Yourself with the Platform’s Features** Take time to explore Minswap’s interface and features. Practice swapping tokens, adding liquidity, and tracking your pool earnings.
