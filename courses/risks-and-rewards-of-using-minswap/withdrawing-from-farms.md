From time to time, you may want to harvest or withdraw your yield farming rewards. You can easily see how much you have earned via the farming dashboard over time.

There are many strategies when it comes to withdrawing and harvesting your rewards, as many like to compound their earnings and deposit their rewards back into the farms, while others may want to change and move their positions or sell off the rewards and take profits.

These steps will guide you through the process of harvesting your rewards.

***

### Navigate to Farms

From the top navigation menu, navigate to **Earn > Farm**.

***

### View Your Rewards

Under each farm where you have staked liquidity, you can expand the rewards area to see how much you have accrued and start the harvesting process.

You can filter the view to show only liquidity pools that you have staked liquidity in to make it easier to navigate.

You also have the option of performing a **Multi-Harvest**, which will optimise your transaction costs and harvest up to five pools at a time.

### Sign and Submit

Enter your password and **Sign and Submit** the transaction to start the harvesting process.
