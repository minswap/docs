# Minswap Governance Proposals

## Creating a Governance Proposal on Minswap

Minswap’s DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) allows its community to directly shape the protocol’s future. By creating governance proposals, $MIN token holders can suggest improvements, request treasury funding, or adjust key parameters that affect the protocol. This ensures that Minswap remains transparent, community-driven, and aligned with the needs of its users.

***

### Why Create a Governance Proposal?

A governance proposal is your opportunity to influence the future of Minswap. By submitting one, you can:

* Suggest updates to fee structures, farming pools, or treasury allocations.
* Propose new initiatives that benefit the ecosystem.
* Secure funding for community projects, audits, or tooling.
* Ensure the protocol evolves in a decentralised, transparent way.

In short, proposals are how the community makes meaningful decisions together.

### The Two Types of Proposals

When starting a proposal, you must first choose the type:

#### **Constitutional**

* These proposals amend the **DAO Operating Agreement** or its processes.
* Examples:
  * Updating fee-sharing mechanisms.
  * Revising governance parameters.
  * Adjusting quorums or legal obligations.
  * Changing token mechanisms or addressing high-risk issues.

#### **Non-Constitutional**

* These proposals are less formal and focus on **funding or feature additions**.
* Examples:
  * Requesting treasury grants.
  * Introducing new protocol features without smart contract changes.
  * Establishing working groups.

***

### The Two Phases of Proposals

Every proposal goes through two voting phases:

#### **Phase 1: Temperature Check**

* Duration: **1 week**.
* Purpose: To gauge community interest with a preliminary vote.
* Outcome: If approved, the proposal advances to the **Official Vote**.

#### **Phase 2: Official Vote**

* Duration: **1 week**.
* Purpose: The DAO makes its **final decision** on your proposal.
* Outcome: If approved, the proposal is enacted.

This two-step process ensures that ideas are discussed, refined, and only implemented if they receive broad community support.

### Submitting a Proposal for Discussion

Before making an on-chain proposal, you must first share your idea on the **Minswap Governance Forum**:\
👉 [Minswap Proposal Forum](https://forum.minswap.org/c/proposals/7)

This allows the community to review, debate, and refine your proposal before it reaches a vote.
