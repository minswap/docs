# What is Governance on Minswap?

## What is Governance on Minswap?

Minswap is governed by its community through a Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO) model, allowing token holders to propose, vote, and decide on key protocol changes and developments.

* The native token **$MIN** is used for voting.
* Anyone holding $MIN can participate.
* Voting is done on-chain for transparency and immutability.

### How Minswap Governance Works

#### Proposal Submission

Community members can create and submit proposals (e.g., fee structure changes, new farming pools, treasury usage).\
Proposals are first discussed off-chain (e.g., Governance Forum) before going on-chain.

#### Snapshot Voting

Voting typically takes place via a snapshot mechanism based on wallet balances at a specific block.\
You vote using your $MIN tokens – the more you hold, the more weight your vote has.

#### Execution

If a proposal passes the required quorum and majority, it is implemented by the core team or via smart contract automation.
