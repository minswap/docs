# Voting on Minswap Proposals

## Voting on Minswap Governance Proposals

Minswap's governance lets **$MIN** holders decide the protocol's future. This guide explains how to read a proposal, cast your vote, and what metadata to check.

***

### Understand the proposal view

* **Proposal details (red area in screenshot)**\
  Links, references, and context so you know exactly what you're voting on (e.g., Cardanoscan links, treasury addresses, summary text).
* **Cast your vote (green area)**\
  The options defined by the proposer (e.g., "Yes, pass the proposal" / "No, do not pass the proposal").
* **Votes list (blue area)**\
  Current votes showing a partial wallet address, the voter's choice, and their **voting power**.

***

### How to vote

1. **Open an active proposal**\
   Go to the Governance page and select a proposal in the _Active_ phase.
2. **Review the details**\
   Read the summary and follow any links provided to fully understand the proposal.
3. **Choose your option**\
   In **Cast your vote**, select your preference.
4. **Click&#x20;**_**Vote**_\
   Then confirm.
5. **Sign the transaction**\
   Approve in your wallet to record the vote **on‑chain**.
6. **Done**\
   Your vote appears in the votes list with your wallet's voting power.

> **Tip:** Voting power is determined by the **$MIN** you held at the **snapshot** time. Ensure your MIN is in your wallet before the snapshot.

### Proposal metadata (right-hand panel)

* **Proposer** – Wallet that created the proposal
* **IPFS** – Link to the proposal document stored on a decentralised server
* **Voting system** – e.g., Single choice
* **Start / End** – Voting window
* **Snapshot** – Balance-block used to calculate voting power
* **Phase** – Temperature check or Official vote
* **Your voting power** – How much your vote counts
* **Quorum** – Minimum participation threshold

### Governance phases (recap)

* **Phase 1: Temperature check**\
  Preliminary one‑week vote to gauge community interest. If approved, it advances.
* **Phase 2: Official vote**\
