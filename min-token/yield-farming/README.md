# Yield Farming

## What is Yield Farming?

Yield Farming is an initiative used by protocols in _DeFi_ to incentivize liquidity and utilization by rewarding users in governance tokens (such as MIN). The idea is to acquire users by giving them **ownership of the protocol itself**, in accordance with the _ethos_ of decentralized protocols that are wholly owned by their users.

In Minswap, this translates to distributing **MIN token rewards** to users who Provide Liquidity on our DEX and stake their Liquidity Provider Tokens (LP Tokens or **LPTs**). Staking LPTs will earn you MIN rewards in proportion to how much the share the LPTs you are staking is compared to the total LPTs staked in the particular farm. Minswap will aim to have an effective system for farming yield, while also offering the best user experience.

## **Yield Farming Vesting Schedule**

### Bootstrapping Phase&#x20;

During the first 5 months after deployment of the DEX, Minswap went through a _Bootstrapping Phase_ using a predictable and aggressive Yield Farming Schedule to bootstrap users and TVL.

**1st month (16th March 2022 to 15th April) :** 1.2% total supply = 60 million MIN ≈ 2,000,000 daily. \
**2nd month (15th April 2022 to 15th May) :** 1.1% total supply = 55 million MIN ≈ 1,833,333 daily \
**3rd month** **(15th** **May 2022 to 14th June) :** 1% total supply = 50 million MIN ≈ 1,666,666 daily. \
**4th month (14th** **June 2022 to 14th July) :** 0.9% total supply = 45 million MIN ≈ 1,500,000 daily. \
**5th month (14th** **July 2022 to 13th August)** **:** 0.8% total supply = 40 million MIN ≈ 1,333,333 daily.

In total, to bootstrap liquidity and to ensure early supporters of Minswap are maximally rewarded, **5% of total supply** was allocated towards _Yield Farming_ in the first 5 months. We welcome any community input regarding pools that could be added and schedule adjustment in our [Forum](https://forum.minswap.org/).

### **Minimax** Phase&#x20;

After the _Bootstrapping Phase_, the Minswap DEX will enter the _"Minimax Phase"_ with a _Dynamic Schedule_ approach for a **4-month Period** meaning from **August 13th 2022 to November 13th 2022**. While at first this process will be conducted _off-chain_, the endgame of a _Dynamic Schedule_ would be to have the Emissions Schedule be determined completely _on-chain_ and for Emissions to be determined according to an algorithmic formula coupled with _on-chain voting_.

During the 4 months of the **Minimax Phase** for the [_Dynamic Schedule_](https://minswap-labs.medium.com/minomics-research-part-2-introducing-dynamic-emission-schedules-974783ef1f8d), Emissions will be increased or decreased within a **50% threshold** of the last Emissions Rate of the first Farming schedule, meaning the Starting Emissions Rate (SER) of ≈ 1,333,333 $MIN emitted daily from July 14th to August 13th. This means Emissions will be increased to a **maximum rate** of ≈1,999,999 $MIN daily, or decreased to a **minimum rate** of ≈666,666 $MIN daily. None of those two scenarios must or will necessarily occur, but those are the bounds set during the **Minimax Phase.**&#x20;

Once the **Minimax Phase** is over, with the first **Emissions Report** released, and provided Governance infrastructure is ready by then, the Minswap DAO will have to vote on whether to continue a _Dynamic Emissions_ _Path_ and if so, what structure to pursue within a _Dynamic Emissions Path_.
