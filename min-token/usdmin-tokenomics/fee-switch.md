# $MIN Staking

On the [Staking Page](https://app.minswap.org/staking) $MIN holders have the Option to stake their $MIN in order to receive $ADA rewards generated from the Fee Switch. Every time someone swaps on Minswap, there is a 0.3% Fee, of which **0.05% is the Fee Switch**. The $ADA generated through is redirected towards $MIN Stakers. Every month $ADA rewards for the entire month are accumulated and then **distributed the month after**. This is similar to how $ADA rewards are distributed to LPs currently.

$MIN stakers essentially **“soft-lock”** their $MIN for a certain amount of time. It’s a “soft-lock” in that stakers may unlock their $MIN at any time, however doing so **early** means they **forfeit their accrued rewards**. Forfeited rewards from early unstaking are collected monthly and distributed to the $MIN stakers afterwards.

In the first iteration of $MIN Staking, the boosts will work the following way:

1. Staking $MIN for **1 month** gives an _unboosted $ADA APR_
2. Staking $MIN for **3 months** — gives a _3x boosted $ADA APR_
3. Staking $MIN for **6 months** — gives a _6x boosted $ADA APR_
4. Staking $MIN for **9 months** — gives a _9x boosted $ADA APR_

Once the **staking period is over**, the $MIN is effectively unstaked, and you may claim rewards anytime. Remember to re-stake your $MIN if you want to continue getting real yield in $ADA!

### $MIN Staking Rewards

In its current iteration, $MIN Stakers will purely have the following 2 benefits:

* $ADA Real Yield coming directly from Trading Fees the platform generates.
* Governance say as any $MIN Holder would have, with the same voting power.

$MIN Stakers currently do **not** have access to benefits such as [reduced Batcher Fees.](trading-fee-discount.md)
