# $MIN Staking

On the [Staking Page](https://app.minswap.org/staking) $MIN holders have two options to stake their $MIN and earn $ADA rewards generated from the Fee Switch, along with potential extra rewards from project incentives. Every time someone swaps on Minswap, there is a 0.3% fee, of which **0.05% is the Fee Switch**. The $ADA generated through it is redirected towards $MIN Stakers. Every month $ADA rewards for the entire month are accumulated and then **distributed the month after**, similar to how $ADA rewards are distributed to LPs.

### **Staking Options**

1. **9-month staking (Tiered Contract):**
   * Users commit their $MIN for a fixed 9-month period and receive consistent staking rewards throughout.
   * This option offers higher rewards due to its long-term commitment.
   * Early redemption is allowed but results in penalties on accrued rewards proportional to how early you redeem.
   * Once the staking period ends, users can claim all rewards and $MIN by redeeming.
2. **Liquid staking:**
   * Users can stake their $MIN with the flexibility to withdraw or reallocate at any time without penalties.
   * Rewards are partially tied to ADA delegation rates and are generally lower than those offered by the 9-month staking option.
   * This option provides greater liquidity and control over staked assets.

### **How Rewards Work**

* The Fee Switch generates $ADA rewards from trading fees, which are distributed monthly to stakers.
* Forfeited rewards from early redemptions in the Tiered Contract are collected and redistributed to other stakers.

### $MIN Staking Rewards

In its current iteration, $MIN Stakers will purely have the following 2 benefits:

* $ADA Real Yield comes directly from Trading Fees the platform generates.
* Governance say as any $MIN Holder would have, with the same voting power.
