# Token Allocations & Vesting

For information on vesting on **Yield Farming**, please go to the subsection of [Yield Farming](../yield-farming/).&#x20;

Tokens from the **Core Team** were locked for the first 6 months after the launch of the protocol (_March 8th 2022_), meaning they were not accessible to team members during that time. After that time period, Team tokens vest linearly during the next 2.5 years.

Regarding the 10% of total supply of tokens from the **Development Fund**, please note 0.5% of them were allocated already. 4% of these tokens was unlocked at launch and the remaining 5.5% will vest in the same schedule as team tokens (6 months cliff and 2.5 years linear).

The **DAO Treasury** has an allocation of 6% of total supply. To bootstrap liquidity on the DEX, 2% of this supply was allocated to the Liquidity Bootstrapping Event.&#x20;

0.2% of the 1.5% of $MIN Tokens for **Incentives/Partnerships** were allocated for the 2 testnet incentivisation campaigns.
