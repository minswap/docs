# DAO Treasury POL

Since the days of the [Meteor LBE](https://minswap-labs.medium.com/meteor-lbe-mainnet-launch-yield-farming-more-f73c6c2a8b37), we have emphasized the importance of the DeFi concept of ["Protocol-Owned Liquidity" (POL)](https://thedefiant.io/what-is-defi-20/). In essence, it means a protocol owning its own liquidity, in the case of Minswap, it would for instance be if the DAO Treasury owned and managed MIN/ADA LP tokens. The Minswap DAO Treasury obtained MIN/ADA LP Tokens following the MIN Liquidity Bootstrapping Event. It and has and will continue to expand its POL through the [Launchbowl Events](https://minswap-labs.medium.com/introducing-the-minswap-launch-bowl-a5db8266345c). So far, INDY/ADA and MCOS/ADA LP Tokens were earned by the DAO Treasury as part of a Fee for facilitiating Launchbowl Events for [Indigo Protocol](https://twitter.com/Indigo\_protocol) and [Mocossi](https://twitter.com/officialmocossi).

In particular, the Minswap DAO Treasury owns, **as of November 25th 2022**:

* MIN/ADA LP Tokens worth _10,642,902 ADA_ (meaning _5,321,451 ADA_ and the equivalent worth in MIN)
* INDY/ADA LP Tokens worth _213,394 ADA_
* MCOS/ADA LP Tokens worth _75,154 ADA_

The addresses for the LP Tokens are the following:

* MIN/ADA LP Tokens: addr1vxs9zqu2lcddy98wml0d7qtpfy2m7shtz0gzkj93ghgkckg373c0h
* INDY/ADA LP Tokens (staked in Yield Farming): addr1q9gxe8vx0kvv5g6gv4n5wmsxexjqsjftc599qqcp2vkmmwh7snv5yhw2qqvdev3c7wn6s3xhrnx25eg6zcqjxj9vrv2s0e38ze
* MCOS/ADA LP Tokens (staked in Yield Farming): addr1q9gxe8vx0kvv5g6gv4n5wmsxexjqsjftc599qqcp2vkmmwh7snv5yhw2qqvdev3c7wn6s3xhrnx25eg6zcqjxj9vrv2s0e38ze

The Value of LP Tokens obviously varies as do the prices of the Tokens. Please stay updated on the [Minswap Twitter page](https://twitter.com/MinswapDEX), where we share a monthly summary that includes the DAO Treasury Assets.
