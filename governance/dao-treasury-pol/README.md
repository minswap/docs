# DAO Treasury POL

Since the days of the [Meteor LBE](https://minswap-labs.medium.com/meteor-lbe-mainnet-launch-yield-farming-more-f73c6c2a8b37), Minswap Labs has focused on the importance of the DeFi concept of ["Protocol-Owned Liquidity" (POL)](https://thedefiant.io/what-is-defi-20/). In essence, it means a protocol owning its own liquidity, in the case of the Minswap DEX, it would for instance be if the DAO Treasury owned and managed MIN/ADA LP tokens.&#x20;

Currently, there are **3 sources** for the DAO Treasury POL:

1. **Meteor Liquidity Bootstrapping Event (LBE):** Minswap was the first Protocol on Cardano to embrace POL through the [Meteor LBE](https://minswap-labs.medium.com/meteor-lbe-mainnet-launch-yield-farming-more-f73c6c2a8b37). The LBE ensured a fair and transparent way to determine the initial price of the MIN/ADA price, while enabling the _DAO Treasury_ to keep 50% of the LP Tokens generated from the event. These **MIN/ADA** LP Tokens are currently not Yield Farming, however they passively accumulate Trading Fees from swaps.
2. **Launchbowl Events:** following the success of the Meteor LBE, Minswap Labs also offers this service for projects to launch new tokens on the DEX through the [Minswap Launchbowl](https://minswap-labs.medium.com/introducing-the-minswap-launch-bowl-a5db8266345c). As part of facilitating this service, a Fee in the LP Tokens generated in the Event is taken for the _Minswap DAO Treasury_. So far, **INDY/ADA** and **MCOS/ADA** LP Tokens were earned by the _DAO Treasury_ as part of a Fee for facilitiating Launchbowl Events for [Indigo Protocol](https://twitter.com/Indigo\_protocol) and [Mocossi](https://twitter.com/officialmocossi). These LP Tokens generate both Trading Fees and Farming rewards.
3. **Fee Switch:** the Fee Switch was activated following the [DAO vote on the activation of the "Fee Switch"](https://app.minswap.org/gov/4c00218a32ede4de1991f869aeb878cb51829c2c87732aff797ec962422370f2). Under the current framework, the **Fee Switch** refers to redirecting 0.05% of the 0.3% Fee that swappers pay to increase the _DAO Treasury's POL_. According to the vote, the Fee Switch aims to deploy the 0.05% of the Fee to increase the **MIN/ADA** Liquidity. These LP Tokens generate both Trading Fees and Farming rewards.
