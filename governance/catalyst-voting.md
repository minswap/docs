# Catalyst Voting

On August 2nd 2023, the Minswap DAO [passed a vote](https://app.minswap.org/gov/09c5399f1cc0291e3b7e17a8d4fd017054bf395fd7fa0a07d410c1f50606a3be) with 98.77% approval to Register the LP ADA in the Minswap DEX to vote on Catalyst.

As part of that process, a group of community volunteers collaborates to filter proposals down to 50.
