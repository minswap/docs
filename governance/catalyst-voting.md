# Catalyst Voting

On August 2nd 2023, the Minswap DAO [passed a vote](https://app.minswap.org/gov/09c5399f1cc0291e3b7e17a8d4fd017054bf395fd7fa0a07d410c1f50606a3be) with 98.77% approval to Register the LP ADA in the Minswap DEX to vote on Catalyst. Minor changes and improvements were made following the [Minswap Catalyst Improvement Proposal](https://app.minswap.org/gov/91b9b7710659e20a949634c3636f909c6edf280b086fdc04147b902c3b78e0f1).

As part of that process, a group of community volunteers collaborates to filter 1000+ Catalyst Proposals down to 65 (it was 50 in Fund 10 and 11).&#x20;

This List of Proposals with all the filtered Proposals, why they were chosen, and the score in Catalyst assessment can be found below.

There are 4 Lists so far:
