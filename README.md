# Introduction

![](.gitbook/assets/minswap\_promo\_twitter.jpg)

Minswap is a Decentralized Exchange (DEX). The purpose of a DEX is to enable permissionless trading of token pairs. For each swap, a fee is taken, which goes to the Liquidity Providers (LPs). Anyone can provide Liquidity as well, hence profits are decentralized. Minswap is a community-centric DEX, in that our tokens are fairly distributed, without any private or VC investment. Minswap has pioneered several ideas in the Cardano ecosystem such as the FISO model, touted as the fairest ISO model in the Cardano community, and we plan to continue developing several value adding features. This will benefit both the Minswap community, and the Cardano community as a whole.&#x20;

## Features

* **Community First:** MIN tokens are distributed fairly to protocol participants and Liquidity Providers, who can participate in [governance](https://forum.minswap.org/) and vote democratically on protocol changes.&#x20;
* **Innovation-Driven:** We pioneered ideas such as the [FISO](https://medium.com/minswap/minswap-fair-launch-tokenomics-and-fiso-airdrop-start-date-a75f3e75a546) model, the [MINt](https://forum.minswap.org/t/mint-token-expose-mint-liquidity-providers-to-other-pairs/40) token,or the [Liquidity Bootstrapping Event](https://minswap-labs.medium.com/meteor-lbe-mainnet-launch-yield-farming-more-f73c6c2a8b37) and plan to continue doing so with further novel initiatives.
* **Launchpool:** Minswap is permissionless, meaning anybody can list tokens without needing KYC. For promising Cardano projects that want to use some of the most potent DeFi primitives to bootrstrap their liquidity directly on the Minswap platform, we have designed the [Minswap Launch Bowl](https://minswap-labs.medium.com/introducing-the-minswap-launch-bowl-a5db8266345c).
* **Stake Pool Operators Support:** Minswap supported SPOs through the FISO and plans to continue doing so with a community-oriented ADA delegation policy, incentivizing SPOs in our batching solution [Laminar](https://medium.com/minswap/introducing-laminar-an-eutxo-scaling-protocol-for-accounting-style-smart-contract-d1ac8847dde8), and by enabling automatic native token fees conversion (Babel Fees).&#x20;
* **Ethereum Compatible**: With the ERC-20 Converter, users can trade Ethereum tokens at much lower fees. &#x20;

## Achievements

* **Q2 2021:** Successfully received funds in [Catalyst Fund 5](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Wp4ypNhssUwOBC9SLkxKgtyJaZ2h0fwl/view), commenced research on constant-product pool, completed [Plutus Pioneer Program](https://testnets.cardano.org/en/plutus-pioneer-program/).
* **Q3 2021:** Deployed Minswap testnet and gathered invaluable [feedback](https://medium.com/minswap/minswap-testnet-reflections-64b01c5e7c45). Launched FISO model, a novel way to distribute tokens to community members. Introduced the [MINt token](faq/mint-token.md) mechanic, ensuring FISO participants are incentivized to partake in the protocol once launched.&#x20;
* **Q4 2021:** Published Minswap´s solution to concurrency, [Laminar](https://minswap-labs.medium.com/introducing-laminar-an-eutxo-scaling-protocol-for-accounting-style-smart-contract-d1ac8847dde8), which aims to execute accounting-style smart contracts multiple times in one block. Raised funds in the [public sale](https://medium.com/minswap/minswap-public-sale-8732843af1bd) to strengthen team and development.&#x20;
* **Q1 2022:** After completion of a[ Security Audit by Tweag](https://minswap-labs.medium.com/minswap-announces-audit-completion-by-tweag-79a2910b98a), Minswap launched on Mainnet. Minswap Launched through a [Liquidity Bootrstrapping Event](https://minswap-labs.medium.com/meteor-lbe-mainnet-launch-yield-farming-more-f73c6c2a8b37), a congestion-friendly and equitable way to distribute the $MIN token, which gathered 25 million $ADA half of which went to the Minswap DAO Treasury in form of $ADA/$MIN LP Tokens.
* **Q2 2022:** Minswap embraced research in [profit sharing](https://minswap-labs.medium.com/minomics-research-part-1-exploring-tokenomic-models-and-revenue-sources-dd59c434e38f) and further innovations around a new type of Emissions Schedule. Introduced features such as [distributing $ADA staking rewards to LPs](https://twitter.com/MinswapDEX/status/1541803084879462400?s=20\&t=C2YA8vWM66zeKhnQW4mgxA), or starting the first [Launch Bowl initiatives](https://app.minswap.org/launch-bowl) to increase the DAO Treasury's Protocol-Owned-Liquidity.

## Token Distribution

78.5% of tokens will be distributed to the community, of which 70% are reserved to reward LPs, ensuring our community of users is maximally rewarded, not speculators and insiders.
