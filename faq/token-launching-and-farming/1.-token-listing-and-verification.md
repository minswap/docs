# 1. Token Listing & Verification

Minswap is a decentralized exchange, which means that anyone can list their token to trade on Minswap. The simplest way to do so is by creating a Liquidity Pool of ADA and your token. Go to [https://app.minswap.org/liquidity](https://app.minswap.org/liquidity) and select ADA for and your token. Ensure that the button **Create new pool (v2)** is visible, if not then the pool is already created.

When creating a pool, you can freely set the amount of ADA and your token. The ratio will determine the initial price after the pool is created. For example, if you set amount ADA to be 1,000 and amount token to 1,000,000 then the price will be 1 ADA = 1,000 token.

### Token Metadata

Currently, Minswap syncs token metadata including decimals and logos from the official [Cardano Token Registry](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-token-registry) every 30 minutes. In order for your token to display with correct decimal and logo on Minswap, you would need to submit your metadata to Cardano Token Registry. Once your submission is accepted, it takes at most 30 minutes to display correctly on Minswap.

### Market Cap Information

Minswap calculates market cap data from public code in a GitHub repository: [https://github.com/minswap/market-cap](https://github.com/minswap/market-cap). In order for your token to have market cap displayed, you should create a PR to this repository, or create an issue and our team will work on it (slower).
