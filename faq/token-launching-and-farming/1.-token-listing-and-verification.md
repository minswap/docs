# 1. Token Listing & Verification

Minswap is a decentralized exchange, which means that anyone can list their token to trade on Minswap. The simplest way to do so is by creating a Liquidity Pool of ADA and your token. Go to [https://app.minswap.org/liquidity](https://app.minswap.org/liquidity) and select ADA for and your token. Ensure that the button **Create new pool (v2)** is visible, if not then the pool is already created.

When creating a pool, you can freely set the amount of ADA and your token. The ratio will determine the initial price after the pool is created. For example, if you set amount ADA to be 1,000 and amount token to 1,000,000 then the price will be 1 ADA = 1,000 token.

### Token Metadata

Currently, Minswap syncs token metadata including decimals and logos from the official [Cardano Token Registry](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-token-registry) and CIP-68. In order for your token to display with correct decimal and logo on Minswap, you can use [Minswap Mint Token](https://minswap.org/launch-bowl/mint-token) service or submit your PR to Cardano Token Registry.

### Verification and market cap

In order for your token to get verified and displayed market cap data, following the instructions on [Minswap-Tokens](https://github.com/minswap/minswap-tokens) repository.

If you tokens are minted from [Minswap Mint Token](https://minswap.org/launch-bowl/mint-token) service, you won't be charged for token verification.
