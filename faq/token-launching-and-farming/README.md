# Token Launching & Farming

This Section covers the following topics:

1. Token Listing: How to List a Token on Minswap, meaning ow to permissionlessly create a Pool for a Token.
2. CoinMarketCap Tracking: instructions if you want your token listed on CMC.
3. Launchbowl - Initiatives Rundown
4. Farming for Projects

\*Disclaimer\* as some projects have asked about the ability to **"burn" or indefinitely lock their LP Tokens away**, this practice is NOT recommended as it is highly likely the Minswap DEX Smart Contract will undergo updates. Those updates may recquire the manual approval and migration of liquidity to a new, updated Smart Contract.&#x20;
